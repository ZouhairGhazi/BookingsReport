# Bookings Report

## Overview
This project simulates a revenue management system designed for a transportation operator. It processes an operator's inventory, which includes transport plans (trains, flights, buses), itineraries, stops, and timetables. The system enables users to analyze sales, forecast demand, and optimize pricing based on a given seat inventory and expected demand.

The goal is to generate a simple booking report that summarizes sales, demand forecasting, and pricing optimization.
